# 1. Ice Breaker: Fantasy Data Science Project

Break into groups of 4.

Task: 

1. Introduce yourself to your group members. Name, background, what you hope to accomplish through the Data Science Fellows program, and at least one hobby.

2. Dream up a "fantasy data science project" that combines at least three of the hobbies in your group. 

For example, if the hobbies are: swimming, surfing, cooking, then a data science project might be:  "Do surfers that eat a high fat diet find it easier to swim back to their board after wiping out? To do this project, we must (a) contact at least 100 surfers, (b) ask them to record the food that they eat for one month, (c) analyze their food intake and divide the surfers into "low fat", "moderate fat", and "high fat" diet, and (d) video them surfing and record the time it takes for them to swim back to their board (and the distance).

You have five minutes to design your project. Then each group will present their data science project to everyone (five minutes total).  Karma points for the most creative and entertaining Fantasy Data Science project!
