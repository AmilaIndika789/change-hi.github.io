### Primary Outcomes
* Understand the workflow for decomposing time-series using climate change data provided in the workshops R-Studio server. 
* Understand key methods for additive/multiplicative models of time-series. 
* Understand exploratory methods of time-series by decomposing climate change trends and variations to identify causes and factors. 
* Experience with R as a tool for exploratory time-series analysis. 
* Understand why exploratory data analysis of a time-series is a crucial tool for a more accurate understanding of data.

### Secondary Outcomes
* Explore evidence of climate change via time series analysis
  - Climate change as evidenced by increasing global temperatures
  - Solar activity does not explain increasing global temperatures
  - A significant factor in increasing global temperatures is increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (greenhouse effect)
  - Increasing CO2 concentrations are due to human generated CO2 emissions
  - Increasing human generated CO2 emissions has increased frequency of climate disasters
  - What is the expected impact of decreasing human generated CO2 emissions 

# Learning Outcomes
* Grasp the process of decomposing time series utilizing climate change data available on the R-Studio server during the workshop.
* Comprehend the exploratory techniques applied to time series analysis by breaking down climate change trends and variations to discern underlying causes and contributing factors.
* Acquire practical experience using R as a tool for delving into exploratory time series analysis.
* Recognize the significance of exploratory data analysis in time series, acknowledging its pivotal role in achieving a more precise understanding of time series data.
