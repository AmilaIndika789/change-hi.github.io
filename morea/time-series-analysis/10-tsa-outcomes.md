### Primary Outcomes
* Understand the workflow for decomposing time-series using climate change data provided in the workshops R-Studio server. 
* Understand key methods for additive/multiplicative models of time-series. 
* Understand exploratory methods of time-series by decomposing climate change trends and variations to identify causes and factors. 
* Experience with R as a tool for exploratory time-series analysis. 
* Understand why exploratory data analysis of a time-series is a crucial tool for a more accurate understanding of data.

### Secondary Outcomes
* Explore evidence of climate change via time series analysis
  - Climate change as evidenced by increasing global temperatures
  - Solar activity does not explain increasing global temperatures
  - A significant factor in increasing global temperatures is increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (greenhouse effect)
  - Increasing CO2 concentrations are due to human generated CO2 emissions
  - Increasing human generated CO2 emissions has increased frequency of climate disasters
  - What is the expected impact of decreasing human generated CO2 emissions
