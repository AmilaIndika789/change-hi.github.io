## Preparation 

If you will be attending remotely, you should download and install R and R-Studio if you do not have these installed on your machine. [Here are some instructions for this](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html#how-to-download-and-install-r)

We want to ensure that you have a smooth and productive experience. To facilitate this,
please take a moment to prepare your computer by installing the necessary software
and packages.
1. R and RStudio: If you haven't already, please download and install R and RStudio
on your machine. You can find the installation files at the following links:
- R: [https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
- RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
You may find the following guide helpful for the above:

2. R Packages: Make sure to install the following R packages by running the following
commands in your R console or RStudio:

`install.packages("ggplot")`

`install.packages("xts")`

`install.packages("TTR")`

`install.packages("tseries")`

These packages are essential for the workshop, and having them installed in advance
will save time and ensure a seamless learning experience. If there are no error
messages, you're all set!

For HI-DSI past workshops attendees, you can login to KOA with your own accounts
and start an Rstudio interactive session. (https://koa.its.hawaii.edu/)
We appreciate your proactive approach to preparing for the workshop, and we look
forward to a productive and engaging session. Thank you!!
