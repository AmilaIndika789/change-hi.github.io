# 1. Ice Breaker: Climate Fresk

Break into small groups. Try to be in a group with people you haven't met before.
 
Task: 

1. Introduce yourself to your group members. Name, background, degree program and one thing about how you protect our planet.

2. Each group will make an educated guess on how each climate change factor is linked to each other, with climate fresk cards.
 
3. Each group will then present their hypothesis.


Hold onto your hypotheses. We will assess the data to see what the data actually says.
