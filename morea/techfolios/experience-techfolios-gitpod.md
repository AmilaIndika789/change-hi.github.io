# 7. TechFolios and GitPod

For this part of the workshop, we'll step through the TechFolios Cloud Development section, which explains how to use GitPod to build a local preview of your professional portfolio.

Point your browser to that page and we'll start going through it together.

Now, spend the remaining time making some initial modifications to either your [essays](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-essays), [resume](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-resume), or [theme](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-theme), following the instructions in the associated QuickStart pages. 

You'll find things now go much faster since you can preview your changes almost instantaneously.

Don't forget to commit your changes when you are done so that the results are published to your publicly accessible portfolio site.
