# 4. TechFolios Quick Start: Initialization

For this part of the workshop, we'll step through the [TechFolios Quick Start: Initialization](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/initialization). 

Point your browser to that page and we'll start going through it together.

<div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **What keeps you up at night?**
<hr/>
There will be a point during this experience where we'll all be paused for several minutes while GitHub builds your portfolio for the first time.

We'll take that opportunity to have each group present what keeps them up at night!

Once we're done with this section of the TechFolios Quick Start, let's take a brief break to stretch before moving on to the next page.  See you in a few minutes.
