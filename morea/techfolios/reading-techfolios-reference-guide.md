## TechFolios Reference Guide

This workshop introduces you to the design of high quality professional portfolios and their implementation using TechFolios. 

During the workshop, we teach you "just enough" about TechFolios to get you started.

However, as you get more into the development of your professional portfolio, you might want to learn about:

* How to format text, images, and video
* How to customize the theme or layout
* How to set up a custom domain name

To help you learn how to do these things, you should consult the [TechFolios documentation](https://techfolios.github.io/).
