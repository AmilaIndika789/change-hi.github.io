# 6. Choose your own adventure

Once you can edit and preview your portfolio in GitPod, you can return to the TechFolios QuickStart and proceed through the following sections more quickly and easily. Just do the edits in the cloud and `control-c control-p return` to see the results immediately. 

To start, do:

* [Quick Start: Configure bio.json](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-bio-json)

Once you done that section, pick any of these sections to work on, as you like:

* [Quick Start: Configure projects](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-projects)
* [Quick Start: Configure essays](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-essays)
* [Quick Start: Configure resume](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-resume)
* [Quick Start: Configure theme](https://techfolios.github.io/docs/quick-start/configure-theme)

You'll find things now go much faster since you can preview your changes almost instantaneously.

Don't forget to commit your changes when you are done so that the results are published to your publicly accessible portfolio site.
